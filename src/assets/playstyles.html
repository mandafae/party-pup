      <h4>Body Slammer</h4>
      <p>Body slammers like to do just that. This play style is characterized by high speed and full contact. Larger breeds tend to be fans of body slamming.</p>

      <h4>Boxer</h4>
      <p>As the name implies, boxers like to play with their front paws a lot. While this play style is common in Boxers, any breed can enjoy it.</p>

      <h4>Cheerleader</h4>
      <p>Cheerleaders like to play outside the group, sometimes acting as the "fun police," breaking up groups of dogs who are playing together. Cheerleading dogs will typically run around the group, barking. Herding breeds are often cheerleaders.</p>

      <h4>Cushy</h4>
      <p>Cushy dogs can play with anyone. They tend to have very "soft" body language during play. Their bodies are curvy, they don't generally face other dogs head-on, and they are good at reading other dogs' signals. Cushy dogs are great at getting shy dogs to come out of their shells.</p>

      <h4>Explorer</h4>
      <p>Explorers tend to keep to themselves. They like to walk around and investigate their surroundings but don't engage with other dogs very often. Hounds love to use their noses for exploring.</p>

      <h4>Shy</h4>
      <p>Shy dogs take some time to warm up. Being shy doesn't imply that they don't like to play; it just takes time for them to get comfortable.</p>

      <h4>Speed Demon</h4>
      <p>Speed demons love to run. Sometimes they don't even care if anyone is chasing them; they just love the feel of the wind on their ears! Sighthounds (like Greyhounds) often fall in this category.</p>

      <h4>Tag, You're It!</h4>
      <p>Dogs with this play style love to play tag. Some dogs will goad other dogs into chasing them, some will assume the role of chaser, and others will do both. Many breeds love to play tag.</p>

      <h4>Wrestler</h4>
      <p>Wrestlers like to wrestle and bite. This is another full contact play style and is characterized by open mouths, lots of biting/gnawing, and rolling around. Many breeds will fall in this category, as it is a very common play style for dogs.</p>
